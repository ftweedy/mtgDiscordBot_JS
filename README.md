This project is to practice Node using a real-world app.  Once finished, this bot could be used for anyone's server managing needs.

To run, start by following the instructions on the Discord site for creating a bot and adding it to your chosen Discord server.  During this process, you will obtain an authorization token.  Copy that token and add it into this code at line 2.  Once setup is complete, just run the script.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### 'node index.js'

This command runs the bot using your computer as the server.
